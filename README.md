## j-cam // Systems Architect

### 20 Years Tenure. Precision-Scale Systems Logic. 
### Currently Executing: [OPERATION: SYSTEM RECOVERY]

I am a Systems Architect focused on **Structural Stabilization** and **Agentic Workflows**. I specialize in "Straightening Patterns"—taking drifting, high-debt legacy codebases and re-laying a foundation that actually holds.

### // THE ACTIVE MISSION: SYSTEM-WIDE MODERNIZATION
**Status:** In Progress (4 Assets Recovered / 68 In Backlog)

I am currently leveraging high-output **Agentic Workflows** to modernize 20 years of technical assets. The goal is to move legacy logic from the "Engine Room" to the "Helm" by enforcing strict governance and logic isolation.

#### Recent Recovery Sprints (Dec 2025):
* **[pattern-library](https://github.com/j-cam/pattern-library):** **System Migration.** Rapidly transitioned a legacy static HTML generator into a modern React library in < 48hrs via agentic workflows. Features logic isolation and Storybook-driven validation.
* **[bttn](https://github.com/j-cam/bttn):** **Structural Stabilization.** Recovered an 8-year-old SCSS library into a polymorphic React system with a CSS-variable "Single Source of Truth."
* **[el-duderino](https://github.com/j-cam/el-duderino):** **Logic Isolation.** Modernized a decoupled framework to ensure strict separation of system rules from the presentation layer.
* **[hajime-boilerplate](https://github.com/j-cam/hajime-boilerplate):** **Foundation Reset.** Stabilized a core industrial starter-kit with modern build-tooling and type-safety.

### // THE CORE PROTOCOL

I build for durability and load-bearing capacity. My modernization work is centered on:

* **Logic Isolation:** Decoupling business rules from execution to prevent system drift.
* **Structural Stabilization:** Squaring the foundation to turn debt into technical leverage.
* **Agentic Orchestration:** Using AI as high-precision tooling to automate the "toil" of recovery.

### // THE ANOMALY STANDARD

> "I don’t aim for theoretical perfection. I deliver systems that are accessible, fast, and actually ship."

I am the person called in when the foundation is cracked and the system is drifting. I don't just write code; I build the governance that allows code to scale without collapsing.

**Practical Logic. Reliable Systems.**
